## Statamic Eloquent Flat File

Proof of concept of using standard laravel models for Statamic flat file data, built on top of [Sushi](https://github.com/calebporzio/sushi) and heavily inspired by [Laravel Flatfile](https://github.com/authanram/laravel-flatfile).

Check out /test, TestController.php and Models\Entry.php to see how it works.
